   * two different ways: If `config.pixelsPerTimeStep` is greater than zero,
   * horizontal position will be proportional to its starting time, allowing to
   * pile several instances for different voices (parts). Otherwise, resulting
   * staff will display notes in a compact form, using minimum horizontal space
   * between musical symbols as regular paper staff does.
   *
   * Clef, key and time signature will be displayed at the leftmost side and the
   * rest of the staff will scroll under this initial signature area accordingly.
   * In case of proportional note positioning, given it starts at pixel zero, the
   * signature area will blink meanwhile it collides with initial active notes.
   * Key and time signature changes will be shown accordingly through score.
   *
   * New configuration features have been introduced through
   * `StaffSVGVisualizerConfig` over basic `VisualizerConfig`.
   *
   * When connected to a player, the visualizer can also highlight
   * the notes being currently played.
